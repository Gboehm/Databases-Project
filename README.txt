README for Eli Abidor and Gunnar Boehm's final database project.

Differences from Progress Report:

Due to time constraints we decided against learning how to make a web application from scratch and decided to instead simply have it in a runnable python file. We are using Python 3.5 with the MYSQL connector to connect it to our MYSQL relational database.

To run the program:
The database will need to be running on the MYSQL workbench with the username 'root' and the password 'root'. We have included the schema for it as well as a setup script which can be ran to add basic information to the database for testing purposes. All python files will need to be placed in the same folder in order for the program to run smoothly.
